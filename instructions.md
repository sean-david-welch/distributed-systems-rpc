### Report

    - A report which details the scenario and services you have used. Additionally, this
      should specify the message formats for data exchange and service actuation.
      The report must have all the headings of the marking scheme including
    • Service Definitions
    • Service Implementations
    • Naming Services.
    • Remote Error Handling & Advanced Features
    • Client - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    • GitHub – link to Github repo

### Program Code

    Upload your source code as a zip file
    Code must also be available in a private GitHub repository, the repo must have a
    commit history, not a last-minute code dump. Include a link to the repository in your
    report.

### Video Presentation

    A video presentation with audio which demonstrates the different parts of your
    application. The presentation should be recorded and not exceed a total of 10
    minutes in duration. The recording should be made by you with your camera and
    microphone on and with the camera view of you and the audio in your own voice
